# snakeAI
Implementing snake from scratch in C++, and then training an AI to play it.

## About
For this project, I had two goals:

1. Familiarize myself further with C++, and get more comfortable with programming in the language
2. Train/implement an AI algorithm in an environment that I created from scratch

Currently, I have implemented the game successsfully, aside from some misc. video-game logistical features (start screen, end screen, etc.). In the near future, I plan to implement an "AI mode" that allows the user to watch the AI play the game instead of interacting with it themselves.

As for the AI itself I have a number of options, but I will most likely go with a path-finding algorithm (like A*) since it would probably perform better than other models in a controlled environment like this.

## Future plans
- [ ] Implement "AI" mode
- [ ] Show score
- [ ] Add start/end screens
