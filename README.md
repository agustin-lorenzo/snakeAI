# snakeAI
Implementing snake from scratch in C++, and then creating an AI to play it.

## About
For this project, I had two goals:

1. Familiarize myself further with C++, and get more comfortable with programming in the language
2. Implement an AI algorithm in an environment that I created from scratch

Currently, I have implemented the game successsfully, aside from some misc. video-game logistical features (start screen, end screen, etc.). I've also implemented an "AI mode" lets the user watch an AI play the game itself. This can be accessed with the `--ai` flag.

In the future I plan to try other approaches to the "AI mode" like training a neural network, or using other pathfinding algorithm.

## Future plans
- [x] Implement "AI mode"
- [ ] Show score
- [ ] Add start/end screens
- [ ] Implement other AI approaches
